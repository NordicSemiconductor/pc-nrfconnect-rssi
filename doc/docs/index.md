# nRF Connect RSSI Viewer

nRF Connect RSSI Viewer is a cross-platform tool that shows dBm per frequency in the 2.4 GHz range. It scans the 2400-2480 MHz range, records signal level on particular frequencies, and presents combined results in several ways.

You can use the tool with a sniffer device to look for interferers, check how channels are used, and to tweak settings like sweep delay and animation duration.

RSSI Viewer is installed and updated using [nRF Connect for Desktop](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-desktop/page/index.html).

## Supported devices

Any of the nRF52 Series boards can be used as the sniffer with the RSSI Viewer application.
When you [select the device](overview.md#select-device), the tool will reprogram the connected board to act as the sniffer.
